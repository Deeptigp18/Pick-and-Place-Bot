# 5.3 Justification of scores given
| Design | Objectives | Score allocated | Justification of scores |
|--------|------------|-----------------|-------------------------|
|1. Robotic Arm with Wheels| It should be semiautomatic |8  |The bot is controlled by app access hence it is semiautomatic.|
|| It should be portable | 7 |The bot can move in all directions and can easily be carried to any desired user location.|
|| It should be safe to use | 8 |The bot is completely safe and its body is precisely built with suitable smooth-edged materials.|
|| It should be easy to use |  12|The bot is controlled through an app, hence it's completely dependent on the user's input. The use of wheels is one of the advantages as well, Therefore it makes it very easy to use.|
|| It should use standard parts |0  |The bot is built using standard and quality parts.|
|| Cost |  4|The cost of building the machine will be quite lower when compared to the datum, making it better.|
|2. Forklift with wheels | It should be semiautomatic | 8 |The bot can be controlled using joysticks and remote controls hence it is semiautomatic.| 
|| It should be portable | -7 |The bot can move in all directions but it has a heavy body hence making it less portable.|
|| It should be safe to use |-8  |The forklift has an open end which makes it vulnerable to dropping the picked objects hence the object may be damaged, hence it is not as safe as compared to the datum.| 
|| It should be easy to use |-6  |The forklift has a lifting mechanism and in some cases, if the bottom surface of the object is uneven and spherical then, it cannot lift it easily, therefore it is not as easy to use as compared to the datum.|
|| It should use standard parts |  5|The bot is built using standard and quality parts.| 
|| Cost | -4 |The cost of building the machine will be higher when compared to the datum, making it less favorable.|
|3. Robotic arm with Caterpillar track | It should be semiautomatic |0  |Datum|
|| It should be portable | 0 |Datum|
|| It should be safe to use |0  |Datum|
|| It should be easy to use |  0|Datum|
|| It should use standard parts |0 |Datum|
|| Cost | 0 |Datum|
|4. Gripper with Ziplines| It should be semiautomatic | -8 |The controlling of this bot requires separate mechanisms and building remote controls hence it is non-automatic | 
|| It should be portable |-14  |The bot is not portable|
|| It should be safe to use |8  |The bot is completely safe to use|
|| It should be easy to use | -6 |As the user handles the bot completely by himself, it may seem to be not so easy to use|
|| It should use standard parts |5 |The bot is built using standard and quality parts.|
|| Cost |-8  |The cost of building the machine will be a lot higher when compared to the datum, making it less favorable.|
