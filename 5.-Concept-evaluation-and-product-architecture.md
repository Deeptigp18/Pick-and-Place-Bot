# 5.3 Justification of scores given
| Design | Objectives | Score allocated | Justification of scores |
|--------|------------|-----------------|-------------------------|
|1. Robotic Arm with Wheels| It should be semiautomatic |8  |The bot is controlled by an app access hence it is semiautomatic|
|| It should be portable | 7 |The bot can move in all directions and can easily be carried to any desired user location|
|| It should be safe to use | 8 |The bot is completely safe and its body is precisely built with suitable smooth-edged materials|
|| It should be easy to use |  12|The bot is controlled through an app, hence it's completely dependent on the user's input. Therefore it makes it very easy to use|
|| It should use standard parts |0  |The bot is built using standard and quality parts.|
|| Cost |  4|The cost of building the machine will be the same as compared to the datum|
|2. Forklift with wheels | It should be semiautomatic | 8 |
|| It should be portable | -7 |
|| It should be safe to use |-8  |
|| It should be easy to use |6  |
|| It should use standard parts |  5|
|| Cost | -4 |
|3. Robotic arm with Caterpillar track | It should be semiautomatic |0  |Datum|
|| It should be portable | 0 |Datum|
|| It should be safe to use |0  |Datum|
|| It should be easy to use |  0|Datum|
|| It should use standard parts |0 |Datum|
|| Cost | 0 |Datum|
|4. Gripper with Ziplines| It should be semiautomatic | -8 |
|| It should be portable |-14  |
|| It should be safe to use |8  |
|| It should be easy to use | 6 |
|| It should use standard parts |5 |
|| Cost |-8  |
