## 7.1 Motor sizing :

By all the means of calculation, we got our total mass of our model to be 3.5kg, and also we got our mass for each sub-parts. thereby we found the torque for each part as shown below and acquired our respective Motor.

a) Moving Unit
|Weigh of the model = 3.5 Kg|
|------------------|
|F = M*A = 3.5*9.81 = 34.335N|
|T=Fr = 34.335*0.039 = 1.3390kg-cm|
|As the torque is 1.19 our desired motor is of 60 RPM
