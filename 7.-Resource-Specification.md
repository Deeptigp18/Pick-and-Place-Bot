## 7.1 Motor sizing :
We are using 2 DC geared motors for the movement of our bot.

### REQUIRED INFORMATION:
| Rated RPM AT 12 V | RATED Torque IN kg-cm AT 12 V|
|-------------------|------------------------------|
|1000 | 0.12|
|500 | 0.25|
|300 | 0.35|
|200 | 0.5|
|100 | 1.2|
|60 | 2|
|30 | 4|
|15 | 8|
|10 | 12|
|3.5 | 30|

By all the means of calculation, we got our total mass of our model to be 4.1kg and also we got our mass for each sub-parts. thereby we found the torque for each part as shown below:

* Dimensions of chassis= (l=25 x b=15 x h=0.1)+(h=0.1 x l=6.5 x b=5.7)= 41.2 cm^3
mass of chassis= density x volume
= 7.8 * 41.2 = 321.36g
* mass of dc motor=  130 x 2= 260g

a) Moving Unit
|Weight of the model = 4.1 Kg|
|------------------|
|F = M*A = 4.1 * 9.81 = 40.221N|
|T=Fr = 40.221*0.039 = 1.56kg-cm|
|As the torque is 1.56, therefore our desired motor is of 60 RPM|
