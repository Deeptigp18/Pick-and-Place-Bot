## 3.Problem Defination
Semiautomatic pick and place is a machine(design) which is portable, which can do pick and place of the objects and which is user friendly. This design must be done within 5,000 rupees, and it should be of the size 2 feet x 2 feet x 2 feet. The machine should weigh below 5 kg and it must have the capacity of carrying maximum of 1.5kg and minimum of 100gm.The machine must be installed with the feature of starting and finishing alerts. The design may be semi-automatic or automatic by using the source of electricity or batteries. The process of creating this design may include the materials like, motors, hard plastic, wires, gears, etc....And it will work for 1 hour. The external look of the design need to be good one ,the user must be pleased by sighting at the object. The machine can come with the extra results like ability to hold the object and carrying it with balance. it must have stabilized grip and arm rotation of 360 degree .This machine should be designed in such a way that, it would help for industrial purpose.
