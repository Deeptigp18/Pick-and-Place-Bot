The movement of parts is done by servomotor, which can rotate approximately up to 190 degrees. The whole circuit is powered by 12-volt adapter and an Arduino Nano is used as the controlling unit. The servo motor for robotic arm is controlled by android mobile. The communication between mobile phone and servo robot arm is done by Bluetooth module HC-05.|https://www.circuitstoday.com/simple-robotic-arm-project-using-arduino|

With the Forward Kinematics we can manually move each robot joint in order to get the desired position. Using the sliders on the left side, we can set the angle of each joint. The final position of the end effector, the X, Y and Z values are calculated and printed on the right side of the screen.|https://howtomechatronics.com/projects/scara-robot-how-to-build-your-own-arduino-based-robot/ |

It demonstrates how a pneumatic power can be utilized to achieve pick and place mechanism.The robotic arm is controlled by 4 pneumatic valves. The valves control the air flow to the pneumatic actuators in order to control the movement of the cylinder stroke. The valves give a manual control to control over the entire arm movement.|https://nevonprojects.com/pneumatic-powered-metal-pick-and-place-arm/|

The bottom driving unit takes the robot to left, right, forward and backward motion. The top gripper unit is to pick and place any object. The driving unit has two motors and also the gripper unit has two motors.How It Works: The robot is connected to the smartphone via bluetooth and takes command from that. Each time when we touch the button on the screen of the phone, robot activates in action.|https://www.instructables.com/Arduino-Pick-N-Place-Android-Robot/|
