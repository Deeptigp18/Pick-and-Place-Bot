The movement of parts is done by servomotor, which can rotate approximately up to 190 degrees. The whole circuit is powered by 12-volt adapter and an Arduino Nano is used as the controlling unit. The servo motor for robotic arm is controlled by android mobile. The communication between mobile phone and servo robot arm is done by Bluetooth module HC-05.|https://www.circuitstoday.com/simple-robotic-arm-project-using-arduino|

With the Forward Kinematics we can manually move each robot joint in order to get the desired position. Using the sliders on the left side, we can set the angle of each joint. The final position of the end effector, the X, Y and Z values are calculated and printed on the right side of the screen.|https://howtomechatronics.com/projects/scara-robot-how-to-build-your-own-arduino-based-robot/ |
